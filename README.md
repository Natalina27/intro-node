### Course Intro

Welcome to this introductory course on Node.js! In this course, you will learn what Node.js is, its history, and how to install it. You will also learn how to create a Command Line Interface (CLI), what are npm and modules, the different types of modules available, how to interact with files, how to download modules using npm, how to write tests with Jest, and how to create an HTTP server, handle requests, and serve a simple website. All of these topics will be taught in the context of building a CLI-based note-taking app, along with a simple website to demonstrate the concepts.

By the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation in Node.js and be ready to move onto building real applications using the platform. It does not matter whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out; this course is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn about Node.js and its many uses.

### History of Node.js

 The Story of Node.js

- Introduction to Node.js:
  > Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
- The Birth of Node.js:
  > Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js, was inspired to create Node.js after seeing a demonstration of Comet, a web application model that allows a server to push data to a client without the client requesting it. He wanted to create a server that could handle a large number of connections simultaneously. He was also frustrated with the limitations of Apache HTTP Server, which was the most popular server at the time.
- The First Release:
  > Node.js was first released in 2009. It was built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which was developed by Google for use in their Chrome web browser. The first version of Node.js was able to run on Linux and Mac OS X, with Windows support added later.
- The Rise of Node.js:
  > Node.js became popular quickly because it could handle a large number of concurrent connections with high throughput. It was also popular because it allowed developers to use JavaScript on the server-side, which was already familiar to many front-end developers. As Node.js gained popularity, the Node.js community grew, and many new modules and frameworks were developed to extend its capabilities.
- Node.js Today:
  > Node.js is now a mature and stable platform used by many companies to build high-performance network applications. It has a large and active community of developers who continue to develop new modules and frameworks to extend its capabilities. Node.js is often used in combination with other technologies, such as databases, front-end frameworks, and cloud platforms, to build full-stack web applications.
